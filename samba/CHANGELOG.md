## 12.1.0

- Revert `config` share name change to avoid user facing change
- Adjust location of Home Assistant config to match latest dev/beta Supervisor
- ~Migrate add-on layout to S6 Overlay~ (forked version already migrated it's layout)

## 11.0.0.2 (forked)

***BREAKING CHANGES:***
- The `homeassistant` share has been renamed BACK to `config` (this will be the final name in the original add-on also)

  ***Note:*** This fork doesn't drop temporarily the access to the `addon_configs` share until the new Supervisor release is out

Nonbreaking changes:
- Update Add-on base image to v14.3.2

## 11.0.0.1 (forked)

***BREAKING CHANGES:***
- Drop support for armhf & i386
- In case of an empty list (`interfaces: []`, this is the default) Samba will run on localhost (127.0.0.1) only, and not on all interfaces. If you previously used the default settings, please list interfaces explicitly. This is due to the changes from the original add-on: localhost by default is added to the interfaces list (to support HEALTHCHECK), so we can't use Samba's default behaviour to run on all interfaces in case of an empty list (there is no empty list from now on).
- Merge changes from original add-on
  - The `config` share has been renamed to `homeassistant`
  - The `addon_configs` share has been added to access public add-on configurations

Nonbreaking changes:
- Update Samba to v4.18.8-r0
- Update Add-on base image to v14.3.1

BREAKING CHANGE: Don't mangle filenames
